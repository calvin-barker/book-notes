### 3.2 Issues with Names and Other Personal Information

*How extensively can we use thinkbabynames.com and similar databases for name variations in our identity graph?*

Alt: BehindTheName, NameAPI, census-based name tables

Things they can be used for:
1. Name normalization (might have some nicknames, diminutives, and variants that can map to a canonical form)
2. Cross-cultural name variants (Juan, Giovanni, Ivan -> John)
3. Gender normalization
4. Fuzzy matching supplemental support/source for phonetic match rules

*How often do people inaccurately write their address ("brooklyn" vs "new york city" vs "new york")*

The USPS mostly relies on ZIP to deal with it. It's complex, but using the correct borough or neighborhood name is generally recommended to ensure timely and accurate delivery.
